# analyticAircraft

This code is part of a project for meteorological data quality control of airborne tail Doppler radars.
The project is sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

This code generates synthetic data for use in testing [Airborne-Radar-QC] (https://github.com/mmbell/Airborne-Radar-QC)

It is command line C++ application. From the top-level directory run

     $ qmake

to create a Makefile or Xcode project for your machine.

Ultimately, it is hoped that some standard test suites like this can be developed and agreed upon for testing radar algorithms and data assimilation techniques. If you are interested in this project, please contact me.
